# Perceptron
Algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers.
## Overview of the Algorithm

Single Layer Perceptron can learn only linearly separable patterns.
It's a simplified model of a biological neuron, simulating one cell's behavior.
A neuron cell gets an input signal -> the signal travels and once it reaches a threshold, the cell activates and gives an output signal.
