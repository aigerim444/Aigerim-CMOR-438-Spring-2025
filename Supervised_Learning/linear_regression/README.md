# The Linear Regression Model #

## Overview ##
Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more predictor variables. 
Regression differs from classification, where the goal is to predict a discrete category or class.

The linear regression model is represented as $$ y=wx+b $$
where 
$$y$$: predicted value (target)
$$x$$: input feature
$$w$$: weight (coefficient)
$$b$$: bias (intercept)
