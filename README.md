# CMOR 438/ INDE 577 Data Science & Machine Learning

This repository houses various supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms taught in INDE 577/CMOR 438 during the Spring 2025 semester at Rice University. Each algorithm's applciations are shown through implementation code and demonstration on datasets.
