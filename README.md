# CMOR 438/ INDE 577 Data Science & Machine Learning

This repository houses various supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms taught in INDE 577/CMOR 438 during the Spring 2025 semester at Rice University. Each algorithm's applciations are shown through implementation code and demonstration on datasets.

## Each Directory Structure
- Each algorithm is implemented using Python
- All implementations use datasets 
- Each algorithm directory has:
  - Python code for implementation
  - A selected dataset
  - Discussion of results
